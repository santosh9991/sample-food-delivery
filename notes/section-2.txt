before an app goes to production pre-processing and optimization is required like removing the comments, code minification, 
code splitting, chenking, image optimization, compress the code etc and bundling of code.
What is needed to make an application production ready

There are lot of other things we need to make our App fast
we need to init npm to use npm to import pacakges into our project. npm manages packages that we are going to install in 
package.json is a configuration for npm
- Our app may be depenedent on few pacakages to run. These are package dependecies.
npm will take care of it.

Most important package is bundler.
It helps in bundling the project. webpack, wheat, parcel
packages the app properly so that it can be push to prod. Create react app uses a webpack and bable bundler.

we can get parcel into our app by using npm. 

There are two types of dependencies that we can have
dev depencies and other is normal dependency
dev depencies - when we are developing app
we will install parcel as a dev depency. we can atcheive it using npm i -D package-name
^ symbol help manage minor versions. If there is any miror version upgrates happen parcel will upgrate autometically
~ will updgrate the major version. 

package-lock.json - keeps the track of exact version that is being installed. Keeps the record of the package or the dependency that is being installed
node_modules will have all the code/ packages needed for our project
package.json is like a configuration and node_modules is like a db
transitive dependency - ex: when we install parcel we get lot of other pacakfges which are depenedent on parcel. These packages are called
transitive dependency
